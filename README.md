# MultiSnpnet Scripts
The site hosts scripts for the analyses in the multiSnpnet paper: Qian, Junyang, Yosuke Tanigawa, Ruilin Li, Robert Tibshirani, Manuel A. Rivas, and Trevor Hastie. "Large-Scale Sparse Regression for Multiple Responses with Applications to UK Biobank." BioRxiv (2020). doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.30.125252

We demonstrated the results of two sets of experiments in the paper, and the scripts are saved in two separate sub-directories:

- [`asthma`](asthma): asthma (binary) and 7 blood biomarkers (continuous)
- [`biomarkers`](biomarkers): 35 biomarkers (all continuous)

In each sub-directory, there is a script for model fitting and a script for performance evaluate on the test set.
